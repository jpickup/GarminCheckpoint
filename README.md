# GarminCheckpoint

Garmin ConnectIQ app displaying information about checkpoints during an activity. It is built for the Fenix 3, although it should work on all newer devices. Displays the name of the next checkpoint, distance to go, time until cut-off and average pace required to get there within that time.
